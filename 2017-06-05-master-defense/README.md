# Master Thesis Presentation
## Hierarchical Abstraction of Execution Traces for Program Comprehension

Visit [kajdreef.github.io/slides/](https://kajdreef.github.io/slides/) to see the slides, or run the presentation locally by executing the following command:

```
$ make
```

and go to the website `http://localhost:8000`. The presentation is build around the [remark](remarkjs.com) framework. As a result, by pressing `c` a second window will be opened linked to the original window, and `p` lets you go into presenter mode which shows a timer, notes, and current and next slide.
